A fix for the last broken version July 2024 in the official repository (see details here https://github.com/realmayus/anki_forvo_dl/pull/114). First, uninstall the current anki_forvo_dl addon from Anki. Close and reopen Anki, and then,  go to Tools > Add-ons > Install from file. Restart Anki and you are good to go! Also, since this is a hotfix, don't forget to check the official addon page to switch back to the official release whenever they integrate the hotfix in order to keep receiving updates. Happy studying!
